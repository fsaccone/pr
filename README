The package manager of the Arcadia Linux distribution.

The main package repository is Olympus, available at
<git://git.francescosaccone.com/olympus>.

Structure of a package repository
---------------------------------

The repository tree must have a set of directories, each named after the
package it represents: each of these directories must contain the following
POSIX shell scripts:

- retrieve:    Fetches and verifies the source of the package.
- configure:   Sets the necessary configurations up before building.
- build:       Compiles the source.
- test:        Tests the build and returns error on failure.
- install:     Installs the built package.

All these scripts will be called in this order with the $prefix variable
exported.

Two other scripts must exist for every package:

- uninstall:   Uninstalls the built package.
- isinstalled: Returns error when the package is not installed.

These will be called with the $prefix variable exported too.

In addition, package directories may also contain a dependencies file, which
must list a package name on each line: every package in this file will be
built prior to the package that contains the file.

Every file inside each package directory will be copied to the temporary
working directory where the package is built.
